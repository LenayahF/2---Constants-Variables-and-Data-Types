## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Terry"
print("\(name): I chose let because in most cases your name doesn't change")
var age = 24
print("\(age): I chose var because your age can change")
var numsteps = 0
print("\(numsteps) : I chose var because the number of steps you take per day can change")
var goal = 0
print("\(goal)  Var because your goal can change")
var average = 0
print("\(average) Var because your average heart rate can change")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
